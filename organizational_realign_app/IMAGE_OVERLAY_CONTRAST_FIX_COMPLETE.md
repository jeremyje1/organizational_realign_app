# Image Overlay Contrast Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary
The issue with image overlays not providing sufficient contrast for text readability has been successfully resolved. All images that have text overlays now use an enhanced overlay system that ensures text remains readable regardless of the underlying image.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced ResponsiveImage Component
- Added support for multiple overlay types (solid, gradient, vignette, diagonal, vertical)
- Implemented opacity controls and color customization
- Added dark mode support for all overlay types

### 2. Consistent Implementation Across Site
- Updated EnhancedHero component to use diagonal overlay for optimal text contrast
- Converted PageHero component to use ResponsiveImage with proper overlay
- Updated PagesBackground components to use the new overlay system
- Ensured consistent presentation across all sections with text over images

### 3. CSS Enhancements
- Added new CSS classes for various overlay effects:
  - `.bg-vignette`: Radial gradient effect
  - `.bg-gradient-overlay`: Vertical gradient
  - `.bg-diagonal-overlay`: Diagonal gradient
- Improved dark mode support with specialized overlay settings

### 4. Performance Considerations
- All overlays implemented with CSS only (no additional image assets)
- Minimal impact on page loading performance
- No additional JavaScript required for overlay functionality

### 5. Accessibility Improvements
- Enhanced text readability over all background images
- Ensured sufficient contrast ratios for WCAG AA compliance
- Improved visual hierarchy and focus management

## Testing Results
- Tested on multiple screen sizes and devices
- Verified text readability across all sections with text over images
- Confirmed compatibility with dark mode settings
- Validated accessibility with screen readers and contrast tools

## Documentation
- Created comprehensive documentation in `/docs/IMAGE_OVERLAY_SYSTEM.md`
- Added usage guidelines and examples for future development
- Documented all available overlay types and configuration options

## Status
