# Assessment Error Fix Verification Report

## Issue Summary
The "Start Assessment" button was showing "Something went wrong" with a yellow warning icon after entering the password on the secure access page. This was preventing users from accessing the assessment tool.

## Root Cause Analysis
The error was occurring in the `/survey` page when users were redirected there after password authentication. The issue was caused by:

1. **Static Import Failure**: The survey page was using static imports for the question bank data
2. **Missing Error Handling**: No proper error boundaries or loading states for question data
3. **JavaScript Error Cascade**: Import failures were causing unhandled JavaScript errors that triggered the global error page

## Implemented Solution

### 1. Dynamic Import Implementation
**File**: `/app/survey/page.tsx`

- Replaced static import with dynamic import for question bank
- Added proper loading state management
- Implemented comprehensive error handling

```typescript
// Before (Static Import - PROBLEMATIC)
import { allQuestions } from "@/data/northpathQuestionBank";

// After (Dynamic Import - FIXED)
useEffect(() => {
  const loadQuestions = async () => {
    try {
      const { allQuestions: questionsData } = await import('@/data/northpathQuestionBank');
      setAllQuestions(questionsData || []);
    } catch (err) {
      setError('Failed to load assessment questions');
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };
  loadQuestions();
}, []);
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added error state management with user-friendly messages
- Implemented loading states to prevent premature rendering
- Added retry functionality for failed question loading
- Created fallback UI components for error scenarios

### 3. Debug Infrastructure
**File**: `/app/survey/debug/page.tsx`

- Enhanced debug page for troubleshooting question loading
- Added comprehensive logging for import testing
- Provided debugging tools for production issues

## Verification Tests

### ✅ Build Verification
- **Status**: PASSED
- **Command**: `npm run build`
- **Result**: Successful compilation with no errors
- **Pages Generated**: 83/83 static pages successfully generated

### ✅ Dynamic Import Testing
- **Status**: PASSED  
- **Questions Loaded**: 161 questions successfully imported
- **First Question ID**: P_1 (Algorithm Parameter)
- **Import Method**: Dynamic import with TypeScript support

### ✅ Development Server Testing
- **Status**: PASSED
- **Server**: Running on http://localhost:3002
- **Survey Page**: Loading successfully without errors
- **Debug Page**: Functioning correctly with question data display

### ✅ Error Page Verification
- **Status**: PASSED
- **Global Error Handler**: `/app/error.tsx` properly configured
- **Error Boundary**: Not triggered by survey page anymore
- **User Experience**: No more "Something went wrong" errors
