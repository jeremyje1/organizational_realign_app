# Assessment Page Fix - Complete âœ…

## Issue Resolved
**Problem**: Assessment page was showing "Assessment not found" when users clicked "Start Assessment" buttons from the homepage.

**Root Cause**: The assessment start page expected a `session_id` parameter (from paid Stripe sessions) but wasn't handling the case where users wanted to start a basic free assessment.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Assessment Flow**
- Modified `/app/assessment/start/page.tsx` to handle both paid and free assessments
- Added `BASIC` tier support for users without session IDs
- Implemented dynamic content based on assessment tier

### 2. **Key Changes Made**
```typescript
// Before: Required session ID, showed error if not found
if (!assessment) {
  return <div>Assessment Not Found</div>;
}

// After: Creates basic assessment if no session ID
useEffect(() => {
  if (sessionId) {
    fetchAssessment(sessionId);
  } else {
    // Set default basic assessment when no session ID
    setAssessment({
      id: 'basic',
      tier: 'BASIC',
      status: 'active',
      instructions: [...]
    });
    setLoading(false);
  }
}, [sessionId]);
```

### 3. **User Experience Improvements**
- **Free Users**: Can now start basic assessments without payment
- **Paid Users**: Still get full premium experience with session IDs
- **Dynamic Headers**: Different messaging for basic vs paid assessments
- **Appropriate Features**: Basic tier excludes team collaboration features
