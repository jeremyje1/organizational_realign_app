  </p>
  <div class="expert-callout">
    <strong>üõ°Ô∏è Irreplaceable Combination:</strong> Our patent-pending algorithms (OCI‚Ñ¢, HOCI‚Ñ¢, JCI‚Ñ¢, DSCH, CRF, LEI) provide statistical precision, while our expert with firsthand reorganization experience delivers implementation guidance no AI tool can replicate.

<!-- ============ GENERAL ============ -->
<section style="max-width:1040px;margin:0 auto;padding:2rem 1rem;">
  <h2 class="heading-lg">General</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>What makes NorthPath different from generic AI tools and typical consultants?</summary>
    <p>
      <strong>Unlike ChatGPT, Claude, or other general AI:</strong> We use <strong>patent-pending organizational algorithms</strong> (OCI‚Ñ¢, HOCI‚Ñ¢, JCI‚Ñ¢, DSCH, CRF, LEI) specifically designed for organizational science‚Äînot generic language models.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Unlike traditional consultants:</strong> We combine statistical precision with expert human guidance from someone who has actually led large-scale reorganizations. You get quantified structural friction analysis <em>plus</em> implementation insights no automated tool can provide.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How long does it take to get our first insights with expert review?</summary>
    <p>
      <strong>Express Diagnostic:</strong> 3-5 business days for your 25-page report plus 30-minute expert strategist debrief.
      <br><strong>One-Time & Comprehensive:</strong> 7-10 business days for full analysis plus 60-90 minute strategy session.
      <br><strong>Enterprise:</strong> Preliminary insights in 5 days, with dedicated expert support throughout.
      <br><br>
      Every package includes both algorithmic precision <em>and</em> expert human guidance from reorganization experience.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Which sectors do you specialize in?</summary>
    <p>
      Higher education, healthcare, nonprofits, and complex corporate environments.
      Each sector has its own version of our diagnostic‚Äîtailored KPIs, regulatory flags,
      benchmark libraries, <strong>plus expert interpretation</strong> from someone who understands the unique challenges of mission-driven organizations.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What are your patent-pending algorithms and how do they work?</summary>
    <p>
      Our <strong>6 proprietary algorithms</strong> are purpose-built for organizational analysis:
      <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>OCI‚Ñ¢</strong> (Organizational Complexity Index) - quantifies structural friction
      <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>HOCI‚Ñ¢</strong> (Hierarchical Optimization Coefficient Index) - measures decision-making efficiency  
      <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>JCI‚Ñ¢</strong> (Job Clarity Index) - evaluates role definition and accountability
      <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>DSCH</strong> (Decisional Span of Control Heuristic) - optimizes reporting structures
      <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>CRF</strong> (Communication Resource Framework) - identifies communication bottlenecks
      <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>LEI</strong> (Leadership Effectiveness Index) - assesses management capacity
      <br><br>
      These aren't generic AI outputs‚Äîthey're statistical models with peer benchmarking that no general-purpose tool can replicate.

<section style="max-width:1040px;margin:0 auto;padding:2rem 1rem;">
  <h2 class="heading-lg">Competitive Advantage</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>How is this different from using ChatGPT or Claude for organizational analysis?</summary>
    <p>
      <strong>Generic AI tools are language models‚Äînot organizational science:</strong>
      <br>‚Ä¢ No statistical benchmarking or peer comparison
      <br>‚Ä¢ No purpose-built algorithms for organizational analysis  
      <br>‚Ä¢ No human expert with reorganization experience
      <br>‚Ä¢ Generic outputs without implementation guidance
      <br><br>

      <br>‚Ä¢ 6 proprietary algorithms designed specifically for organizational science
      <br>‚Ä¢ Statistical benchmarking with industry peers

    <summary>What makes your algorithms "patent-pending" and proprietary?</summary>
    <p>
      Our algorithms are purpose-built mathematical models for organizational analysis, not adapted from generic AI:
      <br><br>
      <strong>Patent-pending innovations include:</strong>
      <br>‚Ä¢ Statistical formulas for quantifying organizational complexity
      <br>‚Ä¢ Benchmarking methodologies for peer comparison
      <br>‚Ä¢ Decision-tree logic for role optimization
      <br>‚Ä¢ Communication flow analysis algorithms
      <br><br>

    <summary>What kind of expert guidance do you provide?</summary>
    <p>
      Our founder Jeremy Estrella has <strong>20+ years leading multi-campus realignments</strong> and student-success initiatives. This isn't theoretical consulting‚Äîit's guidance from someone who has:

<!-- ============ DATA & SECURITY ============ -->
<section style="max-width:1040px;margin:0 auto;padding:2rem 1rem;">
  <h2 class="heading-lg">Data &amp; Security</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Is my data secure?</summary>
    <p>
      Yes. All uploads are encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256).
      We maintain role-based access and follow SOC-2‚Äìaligned policies. HIPAA and FERPA
      addenda are available for healthcare and education clients.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Team collaboration features</strong> include secure email invitations, role-based permissions, and audit trails for all access.

    <summary>Who owns the assessment results?</summary>
    <p>
      You do. NorthPath retains anonymized, aggregated benchmarks only with your consent‚Äînever identifiable data.
      Your algorithmic analysis and expert guidance remain your proprietary insights.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Can we run the diagnostic without sharing PII?</summary>
    <p>
      Absolutely. Our algorithms only need org charts, role titles, budget lines,
      and aggregated HR data. Personal identifiers can be masked or removed before upload.
      The patent-pending analysis works with structural data, not personal information.
