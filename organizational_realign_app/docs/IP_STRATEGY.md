# Intellectual Property Strategy for Organizational Realignment App (ORA)

## Overview

The Organizational Realignment App (ORA), developed under NorthPath Strategies, is a SaaS platform that enables colleges and universities to assess and optimize their organizational structure based on strategic alignment, staffing models, and data-driven recommendations.

This document outlines a strategic approach to intellectual property (IP) protection, including whether patenting is recommended and what alternative protections should be pursued.

## Patent Assessment

### Patent Consideration

A patent **may** be considered **if** the following are true:

* The platform contains a **novel and non-obvious technical innovation**, such as a proprietary machine learning model for structure optimization.
* The **scenario scoring algorithm** or realignment simulation engine cannot be easily replicated and offers a demonstrable technical advance over existing solutions.

### Current Evaluation

At this stage, the product’s uniqueness lies more in:

* Application of existing technologies (React, NestJS, PostgreSQL, Auth0, etc.)
* Strategic consulting methodology
* Domain-specific knowledge of higher education realignment

**Conclusion**: A patent is likely *not necessary* unless a clearly patentable ML method or backend optimization algorithm is developed later (see Roadmap Q1 2026).

## Recommended Protections

| Protection Type        | Covers                                                       | Recommended               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| **Copyright**          | Survey questions, assessment flows, reports, UI/UX designs   | ✅ Yes                     |
| **Trade Secret**       | Backend scoring logic, scenario models, recommendation rules | ✅ Yes                     |
| **Trademark**          | App name, logo, brand identity (NorthPath)                   | ✅ Yes                     |
| **Provisional Patent** | Potential ML engine if novel technical approach is created   | ⚠️ Consider if applicable |

---

## Strategic Notes

* **Keep backend logic private** and off public repositories.
* **Trademark** "NorthPath Strategies" and associated logos or sub-brands.
* Use **copyright registration** for questionnaires, UI flows, dashboards, and visualized reports.
* If a proprietary ML method is introduced, consider filing a **provisional patent** to secure a 12-month window for further development.

## Next Steps

1. Register trademark(s) for NorthPath.
2. Add copyright notice and license headers to source code and reports.
3. Protect internal scoring models and algorithms as trade secrets.
4. Revisit patent discussion upon ML feature development in 2026.
