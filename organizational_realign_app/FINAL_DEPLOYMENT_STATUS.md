- @testing-library/react compatibility issues
- Multiple package version mismatches

**Impact**: 
- ‚úÖ Core functionality works perfectly
- ‚úÖ All tests pass
- ‚úÖ API endpoints are ready
- ‚ùå Cannot generate production build

**Resolution Required**:
1. Clean dependency resolution (React 18 ecosystem)
2. Update incompatible packages
3. Generate production build for deployment

2. Update API endpoints in production
3. Deploy filtering logic
4. Test end-to-end user journey

### Option 2: Full Build Resolution
Resolve all dependency conflicts:
1. Create fresh Next.js project with compatible versions
