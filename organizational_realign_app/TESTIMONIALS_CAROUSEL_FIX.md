# TestimonialsCarousel Component Fix

## Issue
The TestimonialsCarousel component had a TypeScript error in the `/app/demos/testimonials-carousel/page.tsx` file:

```
'TestimonialsCarousel' cannot be used as a JSX component.
Its type '() => void' is not a valid JSX element type.
Type '() => void' is not assignable to type '(props: any, deprecatedLegacyContext?: any) => ReactNode'.
Type 'void' is not assignable to type 'ReactNode'.
```

## Cause
The component implementation in `/components/TestimonialsCarousel.tsx` was incorrectly structured. It appeared to only return a cleanup function rather than a proper React component structure with JSX.

## Solution
- Completely rewrote the TestimonialsCarousel component with proper React structure
- Added necessary imports and animation variants
- Created a proper data interface for testimonials
- Implemented carousel functionality with:
  - Auto-scrolling with 5-second interval
  - Manual navigation controls (previous/next buttons)
  - Play/pause functionality
  - Navigation dots
  - Smooth animations between slides
  - Proper accessibility attributes

## Files Modified
1. `/components/TestimonialsCarousel.tsx` - Rewrote the component with proper React structure
2. `/app/demos/testimonials-carousel/page.tsx` - No major changes needed, just refreshed the component reference

## Testing
The development server has been started to test the component. The testimonials carousel demo should now work correctly without any TypeScript errors.

## Additional Notes
- The carousel is now fully responsive and accessible
- Animation transitions have been optimized for a smoother user experience
- The component includes proper cleanup of timers when unmounting
