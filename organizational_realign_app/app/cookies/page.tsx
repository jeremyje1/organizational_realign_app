            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              This Cookie Policy explains how NorthPath Strategies ("we", "us", or "our") uses cookies and similar technologies 
              to recognize you when you visit our website at northpathstrategies.org ("Website"). It explains what these technologies 
              are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.
            </p>

            <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
            <p>
              Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies 
              are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to 
              provide reporting information.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, NorthPath Strategies) are called "first-party cookies". Cookies 
              set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies". Third-party cookies enable third-party 
              features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). 
              The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question 
              and also when it visits certain other websites.
            </p>

            <h2>Why do we use cookies?</h2>
            <p>
              We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in 
              order for our Website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies 
              also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Website. Third parties 
              serve cookies through our Website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes.
            </p>

            <h2>The specific types of cookies served through our Website and the purposes they perform</h2>
            <p>
              The specific types of first and third-party cookies served through our Website and the purposes they perform are 
              described below:
            </p>

            <h3>Essential website cookies</h3>
            <p>
              These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our Website and to use some of 
              its features, such as access to secure areas.
            </p>

            <h3>Performance and functionality cookies</h3>
            <p>
              These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our Website but are non-essential to their use. 
              However, without these cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable.
            </p>

            <h3>Analytics and customization cookies</h3>
            <p>
              These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our Website is being 
              used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our Website for you.
            </p>

            <h3>Advertising cookies</h3>
            <p>
              These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like preventing the 
              same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers, and in some cases 
              selecting advertisements that are based on your interests.
            </p>

            <h2>How can you control cookies?</h2>
            <p>
              You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie rights by setting your 
              preferences in the Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select which categories of cookies 
              you accept or reject. Essential cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with services.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can also set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may 
              still use our website though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be restricted. As the means 
              by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your 
              browser's help menu for more information.
            </p>

            <h2>How often will you update this Cookie Policy?</h2>
            <p>
              We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for 
              other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Please therefore revisit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed 
              about our use of cookies and related technologies.
