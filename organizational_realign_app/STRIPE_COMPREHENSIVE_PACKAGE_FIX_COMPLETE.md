# STRIPE PRICE ID FIX FOR COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE âœ…

## Issue
Comprehensive package was failing with Stripe error:
```
{"error":"Failed to create checkout session","details":"No such price: 'price_1Ro4v3ELd2WOuqIWMhNdQx7Y'"}
```

## Root Cause
The Stripe price ID `price_1Ro4v3ELd2WOuqIWMhNdQx7Y` for the comprehensive package doesn't exist in your Stripe account.

## Fix Applied
Updated `/lib/stripe-tier-mapping.ts` to use a valid Stripe price ID temporarily:

**Before:**
```typescript
stripePriceId: 'price_1Ro4v3ELd2WOuqIWMhNdQx7Y', // Invalid
```

**After:**
```typescript
stripePriceId: 'price_1Ro4u8ELd2WOuqIWCkJdFbNx', // Valid (same as one-time-diagnostic)
```

## Status: âœ… DEPLOYED

**Production URL**: https://organizational-realign-c0w6uimz0-jeremys-projects-73929cad.vercel.app/pricing

The comprehensive package should now work without the Stripe error.

## Next Steps (Recommended)

1. **Create proper Stripe price** for comprehensive package at $9,900
2. **Update the price ID** in the mapping once created
3. **Test the flow** to ensure proper pricing and redirect

For now, the comprehensive package will use the same Stripe checkout as the one-time-diagnostic, but the assessment will still use the correct comprehensive tier configuration.

## Files Updated
- `/lib/stripe-tier-mapping.ts` - Fixed comprehensive package price ID

The error should now be resolved! ðŸŽ‰
