# STRIPE TIER SEPARATION COMPLETE ✅

## Summary
Successfully separated AI Blueprint and Organizational Assessment tier mappings to resolve Stripe price ID confusion and fix all assessment flow errors.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Stripe Price ID Confusion
- **Problem**: AI Blueprint and organizational assessment tiers sharing the same Stripe mapping, causing wrong price IDs
- **Solution**: Created separate mapping files with proper type isolation

### 2. Build Errors
- **Problem**: Missing tier configurations in assessment pages
- **Solution**: Updated all assessment pages to use only organizational tiers

### 3. Runtime Errors
- **Problem**: Guardrails destructuring and "Invalid tier" API errors
- **Solution**: Fixed all tier validation and fallback logic

## Files Updated

### Tier Mapping Separation
- `/lib/stripe-tier-mapping.ts` - Now only organizational tiers
- `/lib/ai-blueprint-tier-mapping.ts` - Only AI Blueprint tiers
- `/lib/tierConfiguration.ts` - Only organizational tier definitions
- `/lib/ai-blueprint-tier-configuration.ts` - Only AI Blueprint tier definitions

### Assessment Flow Fixes
- `/app/assessment/onboarding/page.tsx` - Uses only organizational tiers
- `/app/assessment/tier-based/page.tsx` - Fixed validation logic and tier references

### Type Definitions
- Updated all TypeScript interfaces to respect product boundaries
- Removed cross-product tier references
