# Admin Testing Interface Guide

## Overview

The admin testing interface provides comprehensive tools for testing and validating the assessment system across all tiers and industries. This system allows administrators to simulate user journeys, validate algorithmic processing, and ensure all features work correctly in different configurations.

- Use test mode flag for all admin tests
- Separate test data from production
- Implement data retention policies

#### 2. Performance Monitoring

- Monitor API response times
- Track database query performance
- Watch memory usage during tests
- Log all test executions

#### 3. Security Considerations

- Restrict admin access to authorized users
- Log all admin actions
- Implement proper authentication
- Use environment-specific configurations
