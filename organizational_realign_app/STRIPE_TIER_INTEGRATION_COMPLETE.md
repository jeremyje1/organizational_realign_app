## ‚úÖ Verification

**Question**: "Will the stripe links take them to the tier they purchase and the options for that tier?"

**Answer**: **YES** - The implementation now ensures:

1. ‚úÖ **Proper Tier Mapping**: Each Stripe price ID maps to specific tier configuration
2. ‚úÖ **Correct Redirects**: Success URLs redirect to tier-specific assessment pages
3. ‚úÖ **Feature Access**: Users immediately have access to purchased tier features
4. ‚úÖ **Tier Assignment**: Webhook properly assigns tier to user account
5. ‚úÖ **Validation**: System validates tier access throughout the application
6. ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Failed payments redirect appropriately

The system now provides a seamless experience where users who purchase a specific tier are immediately granted access to all features and capabilities included in that tier, with proper validation and security controls in place.
