# Security Best Practices for NorthPath Strategies Project

## Handling Sensitive Information

### Environment Variables
- **Never commit** `.env` files to the repository
- Use `.env.example` files with placeholder values instead
- Set environment variables directly in deployment platforms (Vercel, etc.)

### API Keys and Secrets
- Always use environment variables for API keys, never hardcode them
- Use different API keys for development and production environments
- Rotate API keys periodically and after team member departures

### Authentication Credentials
- Never commit user credentials to the repository
- Use secure authentication providers (Auth0, NextAuth, Supabase Auth)
- Implement proper session management and token handling

## GitHub Repository Security

### Pre-commit Hooks
- A pre-commit hook has been set up to prevent committing sensitive information
- The hook checks for common patterns of API keys and secrets
- To bypass (NOT RECOMMENDED), use `git commit --no-verify`

### Branch Protection
- Main branches should be protected with required reviews
- Enable GitHub Secret Scanning alerts
- Implement status checks before merging

## Deployment Security

### Vercel Environment Variables
- Set environment variables in the Vercel dashboard
- Use different values for Preview and Production environments
- Restrict environment variable access to team members who need it

### Database Security
- Use connection pooling where possible
- Implement row-level security for multi-tenant data
- Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection

## Regular Security Audits

### Dependency Scanning
- Regularly run `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities
- Update dependencies promptly when security issues are found
- Consider using automated dependency scanning tools

### Code Review
- Always review code for security issues before merging
- Look for hardcoded secrets, insecure API endpoints, etc.
- Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

## Incident Response

### If Secrets Are Exposed
1. Immediately rotate the compromised keys/secrets
2. Check access logs for unauthorized usage
3. Document the incident and improve processes to prevent recurrence
