## üîß TECHNICAL RESOLUTION SUMMARY

### **Issue Resolved**: Server Component Conflicts
- **Problem**: Advanced optimization components couldn't be imported directly in layout.tsx
- **Solution**: Created `ClientOptimizations.tsx` wrapper with dynamic imports
- **Result**: All advanced features restored without build conflicts

### **Components Successfully Integrated**:
```typescript
// Dynamic imports with SSR disabled
const AdvancedOptimizations = dynamic(
  () => import('@/components/advanced/AdvancedOptimizations'),
  { ssr: false, loading: () => null }
);

const PerformanceOptimizations = dynamic(
  () => import('@/components/performance/PerformanceOptimizations'),
  { ssr: false, loading: () => null }
);

const EnhancedSEO = dynamic(
  () => import('@/components/seo/EnhancedSEO'),
  { ssr: false, loading: () => null }
);
```

### **Default Exports Added**:
- `AdvancedOptimizations.tsx`: Main component combining all optimization functions
- `PerformanceOptimizations.tsx`: Initialization component with service worker registration
- `EnhancedSEO.tsx`: Already had proper default export
