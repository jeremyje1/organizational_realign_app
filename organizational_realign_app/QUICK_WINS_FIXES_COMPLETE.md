# Quick Wins Assessment Fixes - COMPLETE

## Issue Report Summary
Your friend reported three key issues with the Quick Wins assessment:

1. **"Invalid or missing tier specified" error** when trying to purchase the cheapest package
2. **Missing email collection** before the free assessment  
3. **Firefox rendering issues** in various browsers

## Fixes Implemented ✅

### 1. Fixed Tier Mapping Error
**Problem**: QuickWinsAssessmentEnhanced was redirecting to `/api/stripe/create-tier-checkout?tier=express-diagnostic` but `express-diagnostic` is not a valid tier.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `components/QuickWinsAssessmentEnhanced.tsx` to use correct tier: `one-time-diagnostic`
- Fixed pricing display: $49.95 (matches Stripe configuration)
- Verified Stripe tier mapping supports `one-time-diagnostic` tier

**Files Modified**:
- `components/QuickWinsAssessmentEnhanced.tsx` - Line 451: Fixed tier parameter and pricing

### 2. Added Email Collection Form
**Problem**: Assessment showed "No email required" but feedback suggested collecting email first.

**Solution**:
- Added email collection form before assessment starts
- User must provide name and email to proceed
- Email and name stored in localStorage for report delivery
- Updated copy throughout the app

**Files Modified**:
- `app/quick-wins/page.tsx` - Added email collection form and logic
- `app/assessment/onboarding/page.tsx` - Updated messaging
- Removed all instances of "No email required" text

### 3. Firefox Browser Compatibility
**Problem**: CSS animations and background effects causing rendering issues in Firefox.

**Solution**:
- Added Firefox-specific CSS optimizations using `@-moz-document`
- Disabled complex animations in Firefox for better performance
- Fixed form input rendering with `-moz-appearance: none`
- Removed problematic `background-attachment: fixed` for Firefox

**Files Modified**:
- `app/globals.css` - Added Firefox-specific CSS rules and optimizations

## Implementation Details

### Email Collection Flow
```typescript
// New flow in quick-wins/page.tsx
1. User clicks "Start Free Assessment" 
2. Email collection form appears
3. User enters name and email (required)
4. Details stored in localStorage
5. Assessment begins
6. Results delivered with collected email
```

### Tier Mapping Fix
```typescript
// Before (broken):
'/api/stripe/create-tier-checkout?tier=express-diagnostic'

// After (working):
'/api/stripe/create-tier-checkout?tier=one-time-diagnostic'
```

### Firefox CSS Optimizations
```css
@-moz-document url-prefix() {
  body {
    background-attachment: scroll;
    animation: none;
  }
  
  .animate-float, .animate-pulse, .animate-bounce {
    animation: none !important;
  }
  
  input[type="email"], input[type="text"] {
    -moz-appearance: none;
    border-radius: var(--radius);
  }
}
```
