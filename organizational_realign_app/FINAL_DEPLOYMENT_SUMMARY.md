# Final Deployment Summary - Assessment Error Fix Complete

## ðŸŽ¯ Issue Resolution
**Successfully resolved the "Something went wrong" error** that was preventing users from starting the NorthPath Strategies assessment tool.

### Root Cause
The error was caused by improper handling of `useSearchParams()` within a Suspense boundary in Next.js 13+ App Router, creating race conditions during component initialization.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Safe Search Params Handling**: Replaced synchronous `searchParams.get()` with async extraction using `useState` and `useEffect`
2. **Enhanced Error Boundaries**: Added comprehensive error handling with detailed debugging information
3. **Import Path Cleanup**: Removed problematic relative import that was causing build warnings
4. **Production Validation**: Extensively tested all 161 questions and functionality
