- Clear connection between questions and operational efficiency

## âœ… Algorithm Validation

### Core Algorithms (All Tiers)

1. **OCI Score Calculation**:
   - Input: Governance and HR questions
   - Logic: Average Likert responses Ã— 20 for 0-100 scale
   - Interpretation: Higher scores = better change readiness

2. **HOCI Score Calculation**:
   - Input: Academic programs and finance questions
   - Logic: Inverted scale (5-average) Ã— 20
   - Interpretation: Lower scores = higher complexity (needs attention)

3. **JCI Score Calculation**:
   - Input: HR and faculty support questions
   - Logic: Average Likert responses Ã— 20
   - Interpretation: Higher scores = better role clarity

### Advanced Algorithms (Higher Tiers)

4. **DSCH Score**: Cost-heavy decision support for operational efficiency
5. **CRF Score**: Cultural adaptability measurement
6. **LEI Score**: Leadership effectiveness evaluation
7. **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Probabilistic cost savings with confidence intervals
