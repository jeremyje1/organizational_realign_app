# CRITICAL FIXES DEPLOYED ✅

## Summary
Fixed all critical routing and pricing issues that were affecting both admin testing and live customer flows.

## 🔧 Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. AI Blueprint Assessment Routing FIXED ✅
**Problem**: AI Blueprint tests were incorrectly going to `/assessment/start` (organizational diagnostic) instead of proper AI Blueprint assessment
**Solution**: 
- Updated admin testing interface to use `/ai-blueprint/assessment` for AI Blueprint tests
- AI Blueprint assessments now properly route to their dedicated assessment flow
- Maintained separation between organizational and AI Blueprint assessment flows

### 2. Enterprise Transformation Pricing FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Enterprise Transformation was showing $24,000 instead of "Contact for Pricing"
**Solution**:
- Updated `lib/products.ts` to set `contactForPricing: true` for Enterprise Transformation
- Modified pricing page to handle contact-for-pricing display logic
- Updated button behavior to redirect to Calendly consultation

### 3. AI Blueprint Higher-Ed Focus MAINTAINED ✅
**Verification**: AI Blueprint assessments are correctly limited to higher education only
- No institution selection in AI Blueprint flow
- AI Blueprint question filtering doesn't reference institutions
- Maintained higher-ed-only focus as intended
