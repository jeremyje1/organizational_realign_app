# Project Overview

The **Organizational Realignment App (ORA)** is a web‑based decision‑support platform that helps higher‑education leaders:
1. **Diagnose** alignment gaps between institutional strategy and organizational structure.  
2. **Model** multiple realignment scenarios using data‑driven recommendations.  
3. **Plan & Track** implementation through collaborative action boards and analytics.

The app surfaces insights from surveys, org‑charts, and performance metrics to recommend structural adjustments that maximize student success and operational efficiency.
