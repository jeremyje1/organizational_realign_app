console.log('==========================================\n');

console.log('üìä IDENTIFIED ISSUES:');
console.log('=====================');
console.log('1. Student services questions appearing in healthcare assessments');
console.log('2. Academic/curriculum questions not relevant for hospital settings');
console.log('3. "Personalized learning" references from other projects');
console.log('4. Generic education questions applied to clinical environments\n');

console.log('üè• HEALTHCARE-SPECIFIC PROBLEMS:');
console.log('=================================');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Student services questions ‚Üí Should be PATIENT services');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Academic programs ‚Üí Should be CLINICAL programs/departments');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Faculty development ‚Üí Should be CLINICAL staff training');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Curriculum mapping ‚Üí Should be CARE pathway optimization');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Enrollment management ‚Üí Should be PATIENT admission/intake');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Student success ‚Üí Should be PATIENT outcomes/satisfaction\n');

console.log('üéØ PROPOSED SOLUTIONS:');
console.log('======================');

console.log('\nüìù 1. HEALTHCARE QUESTION REPLACEMENTS:');
console.log('---------------------------------------');
console.log('OLD: "Student services are integrated and provide comprehensive support"');
console.log('NEW: "Patient support services are integrated across care continuum"');
console.log('');
console.log('OLD: "Academic programs are regularly reviewed"'); 
console.log('NEW: "Clinical programs and care pathways are regularly reviewed"');
console.log('');
console.log('OLD: "Faculty development programs include training"');
console.log('NEW: "Clinical staff development includes continuing education"');
console.log('');
console.log('OLD: "Course fill rates receive systematic intervention"');
console.log('NEW: "Underutilized clinical services receive systematic review"');

console.log('\nüìù 2. RESEARCH INSTITUTION DISTINCTIONS:');
console.log('----------------------------------------');
console.log('For Academic Medical Centers and Research Hospitals:');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Include resident/fellow training questions');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Add research program coordination questions'); 
console.log('‚Ä¢ Include clinical trial management questions');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Add teaching hospital operational questions');

console.log('\nüìù 3. REMOVE NON-APPLICABLE CONCEPTS:');
console.log('------------------------------------');
console.log('‚ùå Remove from healthcare: "personalized learning"');
console.log('‚ùå Remove from healthcare: "student lifecycle"');
console.log('‚ùå Remove from healthcare: "semester-to-semester"');
console.log('‚ùå Remove from healthcare: "academic integrity"');
console.log('‚ùå Remove from healthcare: "curriculum mapping"');

console.log('\n‚úÖ CORRECTED HEALTHCARE SECTIONS:');

console.log('\nüéØ NEXT STEPS:');
console.log('==============');
console.log('1. Update enhancedQuestionBankV3.ts with healthcare-specific questions');
console.log('2. Remove education terminology from healthcare context');
console.log('3. Add proper filtering to prevent cross-industry question leakage');
console.log('4. Test comprehensive diagnostic for each industry type');
console.log('5. Validate question relevance matches organizational purpose\n');

console.log('üöÄ This will ensure each industry gets 100+ relevant, targeted questions!');
