# Enhanced Question Bank for Advanced Analytics

## ðŸŽ¯ **Analysis of Current Gaps**

The current 116-question assessment covers operational excellence well, but lacks strategic context needed for:

1. **Historical Trend Analysis** - No baseline tracking questions
2. **Industry Benchmarking** - Limited competitive context questions  
3. **Peer Comparison** - Insufficient institutional profiling data
4. **Strategic Positioning** - Missing market position and aspiration questions
