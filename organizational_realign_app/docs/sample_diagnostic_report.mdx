## Detailed Findings (excerpt)

### 1. Data Governance (Score 0.41)

* 6 distinct “source of truth” systems for enrolment data.  
* No formal data‑dictionary; 14 % of BI reports rely on manual CSV uploads.  

**Recommendation:** stand up a single Student‑360 table in the data warehouse; migrate priority reports.

### 2. Span‑of‑Control (Score 0.46)

* 28 % of managers supervise ≤ 3 FTE.  
* Benchmark target is 8–12 FTE for similar institutions.  

**Recommendation:** consolidate micro‑teams, repurpose freed capacity to project governance.

## Methodology  {.page-break-before}

Scores are calculated with the NorthPath v2 algorithm:
weighted_score = Σ ( factor_weight × normalised_item_score )

*Factor weights = SpanControl 0.25, Culture 0.25, TechFit 0.20, Readiness 0.30.*  
Confidence intervals reflect data‑completeness penalties (–0.05 per missing mandatory datum).  
Industry benchmarks come from a rolling anonymised dataset of > 150 assessments.
