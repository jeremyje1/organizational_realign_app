# 🎯 INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC QUESTION BANK - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION

## 📋 Issue Resolution Summary

### ✅ Problems Identified & Fixed:

**Original Issue:** Healthcare/hospital comprehensive diagnostics contained inappropriate "student services" questions from education sector, creating confusion and reducing assessment relevance.

**Root Cause:** Question bank lacked proper industry-specific filtering and contained cross-contamination between institutional types.

### 🔧 Implementation Details

**File Updated:** `/lib/enhancedQuestionBankV3.ts`

**Key Changes:**
1. **Healthcare Questions Transformation:**
   - ❌ "Student services are integrated..." → ✅ "Patient support services are integrated across care continuum"
   - ❌ "Academic programs are reviewed..." → ✅ "Clinical programs and care pathways are reviewed"  
   - ❌ "Faculty development programs..." → ✅ "Clinical staff development programs"

2. **Industry-Specific Section Creation:**
   - **Healthcare:** Patient Care & Clinical Excellence, Clinical Operations, Medical Staff Development
   - **Higher Education:** Academic Excellence & Student Success, Faculty Support
   - **Nonprofit:** Mission Impact & Community Engagement, Volunteer Management
   - **Corporate:** Market Competitiveness & Innovation, Business Intelligence
   - **Government:** Public Service & Regulatory Compliance, Digital Government

3. **Enhanced Filtering Logic:**
   ```typescript
   organizationTypes: ["healthcare"] // Only appears for healthcare
   organizationTypes: ["higher-education"] // Only appears for education
   // No organizationTypes = appears for all (core questions)
   ```
