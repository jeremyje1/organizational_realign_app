# QUESTIONS_INSTRUCTIONS.md

## Purpose
This file defines the functional areas, question format, and implementa## AI Generation Prompt (Future Implementation)
For future AI report generation functionality:
```
You are NorthPath's organizational strategy assistant. Based on the assessment answers, generate:
- Executive summary of organizational strengths and challenges
- Functional area analysis across the 11 categories
- Priority recommendations for organizational improvement
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Implementation roadmap with quick wins and long-term goals
```uctions for GitHub Copilot to use when applying the Organizational Realignment Assessment questions in the NorthPath application codebase.

The questions guide college leaders through a 14-section diagnostic survey. The answers are used to generate AI-powered reports for structural redesign.

## Question Structure
Each question is an object with the following fields:

```ts
{
  id: string;                        // unique identifier (e.g., 'inst-1')
  text: string;                      // question prompt/text
  area: string;                      // functional category (e.g., 'Institutional Overview')
  type: "likert" | "select" | "multi-select" | "number" | "text";  // question input type
  options?: string[];                // optional: for select/multi-select questions
  conditional?: { dependsOn: string; value: string };  // optional: conditional logic
}
```

All questions are stored in a single array called `questions` in `app/data/questions.ts`. This array is imported by the frontend assessment wizard, backend scoring pipeline, and survey components.

## Usage Notes
- Frontend renders questions by functional area/section in the survey page (`/survey`)
- Questions are loaded via the `useQuestions` hook from static data in `app/data/questions.ts`
- Survey navigation is handled by the `useSurvey` hook with section-based grouping
- Backend accepts answers via the `/api/survey` endpoint
- Question types supported:
  - `likert`: 5-point scale using LikertInput component
  - `number`: Numeric input using NumericInput component
  - `select`: Single choice dropdown with predefined options
  - `multi-select`: Multiple choice selection (future implementation)
  - `text`: Free-form text input
- Answers are stored in Supabase via the `survey_responses` table

## AI Generation Prompt (System)
Used in `generateReport.ts`:
```
You are NorthPathâ€™s organizational strategy assistant. Based on the assessment answers, generate:
- Executive summary
- Heatmap (1â€“5 scale)
- Top 5 risks
- Top 5 quick wins
- Bronze/Silver/Gold consulting recommendations
```

## Copilot Instructions
GitHub Copilot should:
1. Use this file to understand the question structure and functional areas
2. Ensure survey UI properly handles all question types (likert, number, select, multi-select, text)
3. Validate that select/multi-select questions include proper options arrays
4. Maintain consistency between question IDs and functional area groupings
5. Follow the TypeScript Question interface when working with question data
6. Use the `area` property for section-based navigation and filtering
7. Ensure proper data flow from `questions.ts` â†’ `useQuestions` â†’ `useSurvey` â†’ Survey UI
